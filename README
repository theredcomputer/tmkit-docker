Important notes
---------------

The image is based on Ubuntu 16.04 / ROS Kinetic. The image will be upgraded to
Ubuntu 18.04 / ROS Melodic in the near future.

To upgrade the image to Ubuntu 18.04 / ROS Melodic, simply replace the two 
(uncommented) instances of the words "kinetic" in the Dockerfile with "melodic".



Getting started
---------------

First, you'll need an image. You may build it by running:
$ ./build.sh

Alternatively, you can acquire a prebuilt image by running:
$ docker pull theredcomputer/tmkit_docker

After building/acquiring the image, create a container from your image (Use "docker images" to 
identify your image_id):
$ ./create_container.sh <name> <image_id>



Using the scripts
-----------------

Start your container:
$ ./start.sh <name>

Open a shell into your container:
$ ./connect.sh <name>

Stop the container:
$ ./stop.sh <name>



Special features
----------------

To run tmkit tests inside the container:
$ cd /code/default
$ ./tmkit_verify.sh <option>      # note: the "sussman_run" option will try the whole shebang
